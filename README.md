# Possible influence of local traveling waves on the reaction speed of subjects (PILTWRSS)

## Experiment:
The subject listened to individual words in the form of 8 adjectives related by semantic meaning and aligned by duration of sound (3 series 600,700,900 ms, 10 repetitions for each original word, i.e. 80 words in each series, all words mixed in pseudo-random order, two identical words never followed each other) and sound pressure of about 60 dB.
After the word began to sound, the subject pressed the button on the remote control with the index finger of his right hand.
The subject's MEG was recorded throughout the experiment.
The experiments involved 24 healthy subjects (17 women and 7 men) with an average age of 27.2 years mean=27.1787 std=4.6422

## Data processing
We constructed distributions of subjects' reactions from the beginning of the word to the moment the remote control button was pressed.
The normality of reaction time distributions was analyzed for each subject and for the group
Outliers were removed using the interquartile range (IQR) method
The duration (in ms) of detection of local surface traveling waves in the grooves of the cerebral cortex was calculated using the method of assessing the phase delay of slow waves (alpha range).
The Pearson correlation between the reaction speed and the duration of the traveling waves was calculated: a) the total duration TW for all channels for each subject and for the group b) the total duration TW for each channel (triplet) for each subject d) the pre-stimulus (250 ms) duration TW for each channel (triplet) for each subject e) the poststimulus (750 ms) duration TW for each channel (triplet) for each subject e) 5 poststimulus intervals (250 ms each) duration TW for each channel (triplet) for each subject
